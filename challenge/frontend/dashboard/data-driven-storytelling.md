Data-Driven Storytelling

Introduction
The Water and Sanitation Dashboard presents data related to water and sanitation issues.
This data-driven story aims to answer key questions and insights derived from the dataset.

1. Filter and Explore
Filtering: The dashboard allows users to filter data by location and problem description.

Users can enter keywords to refine the dataset, making it easier to focus on specific issues.

Date Range: Users can also filter data by a specified start and end date.

This feature helps users narrow down their analysis to a particular time frame.

2. Bar Chart
Bar Chart: The first visualization is a bar chart.

It displays the distribution of water and sanitation issues based on the applied filters.
Key Insights:

Identify areas with the highest number of reported issues.
Observe which problem descriptions are most common.
Understand how the dataset changes over time based on the date range filters.

3. Pie Chart
Pie Chart: The second visualization is a pie chart.

It provides a visual breakdown of problem descriptions within the dataset.
Key Insights:

Quickly grasp the relative proportions of different types of problems.
Identify whether a specific issue dominates the dataset.

4. Map
Geospatial Map: The third visualization is a map.

It visualizes the location of water and sanitation issues on a geographical map.
Key Insights:

Geographically pinpoint areas with a high concentration of issues.
Observe spatial patterns or clusters of problems.
Explore if certain locations have persistent problems.

Conclusion
The Water and Sanitation Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of data related to water and sanitation issues.
Users can filter, explore, and gain valuable insights from the dataset using interactive controls and visualizations.
The combination of charts and maps offers a well-rounded perspective on the dataset, enabling data-driven decision-making and deeper understanding of the water and sanitation situation.
